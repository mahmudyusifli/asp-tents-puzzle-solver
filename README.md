# Rules

* Place tents on the grid, so that each tree has a unique horizontally or vertically adjacent tent. This also means that no tent can "serve" more than one tree.
* Tents should not be adjacent to each other (neither horizontally, nor vertically, and also not diagonally).
* The given numbers for rows and columns have be equal to the number of placed tents in the respective row or column.

# Task

Your main task is to implement an automated solver that can solve Tents puzzles, ideally of any size.
